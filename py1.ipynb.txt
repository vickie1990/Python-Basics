    "\n",
    "- Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.\n",
    "- The implementation of Python was started in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.\n",
    "- In February 1991, Guido Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.\n",
    "- In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "- Python 2.0 added new features such as list comprehensions, garbage collection systems.\n",
    "- ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language, which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System.\n",
    "- The following programming languages influence Python:\n",

    "# What is Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast."

    "# Python Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides many useful features which make it popular and valuable from the other programming languages. It supports object-oriented programming, procedural programming approaches and provides dynamic memory allocation. We have listed below a few essential features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy to Learn and Use\n",
    "Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages. Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreted Language\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-platform Language\n",
    "Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language. It enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing a program only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented Language\n",
    "Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large Standard Library\n",
    "It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrated\n",
    "It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and JAVA, etc. Python runs code line by line like C,C++ Java. It makes easy to debug the code."

    "Buildbot and Apache Gumps are used for automated continuous compilation and testing.\n",
    "Round or Trac for bug tracking and project management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scientific and Numeric\n",
    "This is the era of Artificial intelligence where the machine can perform the task the same as the human. Python language is the most suitable language for Artificial intelligence or machine learning. It consists of many scientific and mathematical libraries, which makes easy to solve complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing machine learning algorithms require complex mathematical calculation. Python has many libraries for scientific and numeric such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc. If you have some basic knowledge of Python, you need to import libraries on the top of the code. Few popular frameworks of machine libraries are given below.\n",
